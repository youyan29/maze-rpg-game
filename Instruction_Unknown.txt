This project is a Java-based Maze RPG game implemented with object-oriented design and JavaFX GUI.
The following instructions explain how to run the project and interact with the game.

1. How to Run the Program
Import the project into your IDE.
Make sure the JavaFX library is added to the module path.
Locate the GameUI.java file (the main entry).
Run the main() method to start the game.

2. Start → Mode Selection
After clicking the Start button, the game will navigate to the Mode Choose interface.
You will see two available modes:
(1) Sample Maze Mode
A fixed, pre-designed 10 * 10 maze layout.
Best for demonstration and testing.
(2) Random Maze Mode
A fully randomized maze generated by the algorithm.
Includes additional interactive features:
Maze Map Panel: Displays the tiles you have visited so far.
Fog Button: Shows the full top-down view of the entire maze temporarily.

3. Random Maze – Special Features
(1) Live Map (Visited Path)
The UI shows a minimap where:
Your current position is highlighted.
All previously walked tiles remain visible.
Unexplored paths stay hidden until discovered.
(2) Fog (Reveal Full Maze)
Clicking Fog will temporarily display the full top-down maze layout
This includes all walls, corridors, forks, and the exit.
After closing Fog mode, the map returns to the visited-only display.
(3) Back Button (Return to Junction)
When you reach a fork and choose any direction, the system records that junction.
At any later time, you may click Back to teleport back to the most recent junction.
This allows strategic backtracking without retracing every step.
You may only backtrack to recorded junctions; other locations cannot be revisited automatically.

4. Maze Gameplay Overview
The player moves through Straight paths, Turns, Rewards, Traps, and Enemy encounters.
Movement can be performed using GUI directional buttons.

5. Battle Controls
Based on the DEX of the character and monster, decide to attack first and then proceed in sequence.
During battle, players can:
Basic Attack – Normal damage
Skill Attack – High damage, costs MP
HP Potion – Restores health (Not occupying round)
MP Potion – Restores magic (Not occupying round)
Cloak – Skip one non-boss battle
Battle ends when the enemy or player reaches 0 HP.

6. Rewards and Inventory
Reward tiles may give:
HP Potion – Restores health
MP Potion – Restores magic
Shield - Add DEF (Immediate use)
Speed shoes - Add DEX Immediate use)
Cloak – Skip one non-boss battle

7. Completion Condition
Reach the designated End tile of the maze.
Defeat the final boss.
Defeating the boss will display the WIN interface, while being defeated will display the LOST interface.

8. Notes
Random mazes are different every time.
Trap tiles force the player to return to the previous junction automatically.
If UI labels show step counters (remaining steps / random steps), they reflect special tile logic.
